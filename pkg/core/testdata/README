This directory contains a simple core file for use in testing.

It was generated by running the following program with go1.9.0.

package main

func main() {
	_ = *(*int)(nil)
}

The core file includes the executable by reference using an absolute
path.  The executable was at /tmp/test, so that path is reproduced
here so the core dump reader can find the executable using this
testdata directory as the base directory.
